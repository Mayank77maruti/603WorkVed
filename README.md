## Prerequisites ✅
> Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Git**: Download and install the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads "Download Git") <br>

  To verify Git is correctly installed, run `git --version` in your terminal. If the command returns a version number, you’re all set!

## Run Locally

> To set up **603-WorkVed** on your machine, follow the steps:

  *1. Fork the repository*
  * Before you start cloning the project, it's a good idea to fork the repository. Forking creates your own copy of the project on GitHub, allowing you to make         changes without affecting the original project. Here's how to do it:
    
    * Go to the Repository: Visit the GitHub page of 603-WorkVed by clicking on this [link](https://github.com/Mayank77maruti/603WorkVed).
    * Click the Fork Button: In the top right corner of the page, you will see a button labeled Fork. Click on it.

    * Wait for the Process to Complete: GitHub will automatically create a copy of the repository in your account. You will be redirected to your forked version         shortly after.
    * Now that you have your own fork, you can proceed to clone it to your local machine!

  *2. Clone the repository*
  * Linux and macOS:

    ```bash
    sudo git clone https://github.com/Mayank77maruti/603WorkVed.git
    ```

  * Windows:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mayank77maruti/603WorkVed.git
    ```

 *3. Navigate to the Project Directory*
  * Once the cloning process is complete, navigate to the project directory with the following command:
   
     ```bash
      cd 603WorkVed
     ```
  *4. Open the file on browser*
  * Open the HTML File: You can view the project by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser:
    
  * Directly in the Browser: Right-click on the `index.html` file and select **"Open with"** your preferred web browser.
    
  * Otherwise, Using the Terminal:
    
      * For Windows:

        start index.html
        ```
